# RR-SJF-Algorithms-C-Program

C program that takes as input, the choices between the Round Robin or the Shortest Job First algorithms. If the user chooses the RR algorithm the program takes the number of processes, the Burst Time and Arrival Time for each process and the Quantum time. If the user chooses the SJF algorithm the program takes the number of processes, and the Burst Time and Arrival Time of each process. Then the program outputs the Waiting Time and Turn Around Time of each process as well as the Average Waiting Time and Average Turn Around Time. Learned C programming and RR and SJF algorithms as well as sorting algorithms.
